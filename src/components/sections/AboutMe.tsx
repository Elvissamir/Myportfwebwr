                    <p>Hey, I'm Elvis, a Venezuelan software engineer.!</p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy learning new things, reading, working out, and cooking. 
                        Listening to music is important for me. My favorite musician is Yanni; I think his compositions are awesome.

                        Now, what about software? I love the whole experience of software engineering: typing on the keyboard, the colors of the code editor,
                        learning a new language, creating a system, and then discovering a bug, going to bed thinking about the strategies to solve the problem, 
                        then the next day finding the solution. The module is finally complete after long hours of effort and testing, the final result... for now.
                    </p>
                    <p>Software development has no end. It keeps growing, there's always something to add or improve, and that's definitely what I like the most about it.</p>
                    <p>Alright, I look forward to hearing from you, talking a little bit, and working together.</p>
